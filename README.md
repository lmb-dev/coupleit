# Couple It!
Couple It! is a daily poetry-based word puzzle game inspired by Wordle. Each day, players are presented with a poetic couplet that has a missing word. The goal is to guess the missing word, which rhymes with another highlighted word in the poem.

## How to Play
1.  **Read the Poem:** Start by reading the couplet for the day. A word will be missing, indicated by an underline.
2.  **Find the Rhyme:** A **bolded** word in the poem serves as your clue for the rhyme.
3.  **Make Your Guess:** Use the on-screen keyboard to type the missing word and press Enter.
4.  **Unlock Hints:** You have up to four attempts. Each incorrect guess unlocks a new hint to help you solve the puzzle.
5.  **Win the Game:** Find the correct word to solve the daily puzzle. You can then view your stats and share your results.
